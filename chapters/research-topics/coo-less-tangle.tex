\section{Coo-less Tangle}\label{coo-less-tangle}
The coordinator-free Tangle is developed by a dedicated research team of the IOTA foundation. There are three concepts proposed for a more decentralized network.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Node accountability} is a reputation system built into the protocol, similar to object reputation systems used in p2p file-sharing such as the Gnutella network \cite{object-reputation-system}. Such a protocol allows making judgments about the authenticity of incoming transactions. The reputation of a node is lowered whenever a node attempts to make a double-spend transaction or issues many re-attachments. Re-attachments are used in IOTA when a transaction is left behind on a branch that is likely to be abandoned.
    \item As mentioned in Section \ref{tip-selection}, the \textbf{tip selection algorithm} is one of the main difficulties in the network. Without the Coo, there are no milestones from which the MCMC random walk algorithm derives. Thus, a new heuristic algorithm is developed using backtracking from a recent tip until it reaches a transaction with a high cumulative weight.    
    \item The \textbf{Stars Concept} is an idea that works with well-known, public and trusted entities such as governments and corporations. These entities issue reference transactions which are similar to the milestones issued by the Coo.
\end{enumerate}

These approaches are implemented and tested on the so-called zero-value testnet (znet).
