\section{Permanodes, Common Nodes and Local Snapshots}\label{permanodes}

A common node only stores transactions back to the last milestone set by the Coo or with the introduction of IRI 1.6.0 \cite{local-snapshots}, a node can manually adjust the time period for making local snapshots. Whenever a milestone is reached, only the account balances are stored in order to minimize the necessary storage requirements for a common node. Thus, the message field and the tag field are dropped whenever a snapshot is made. In order to access data from a previous checkpoint, a common node relies on permanodes. An alternative is to subscribe to a specific tag. Whenever an incoming transaction features this tag, the node stores it locally. This requires additional hardware with higher storage capacity that monitor the tangle and store the desired data. 

Permanodes are computers with large storage and bandwidth capacity that store the entire history of the Tangle. At the time of writing this thesis, the Tangle grows nearly 3GB in size every week with a total size of 300GB since day one. A permanodes also has the ability to make snapshots in order to reduce the size. 

There are permanodes that offer a pay-per-request business model, where data from previous snapshots can be retrieved.
