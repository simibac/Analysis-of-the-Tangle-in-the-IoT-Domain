\section{Permanodes vs Common Nodes}

A common node only stores transactions back to the last milestone set by the Coo. Whenever a milestone is reached, only the account balances are stored in order to minimize the necessary storage requirements for a common node. Thus, the message field and the tag field are also dropped when the Coo creates a milestone. In order to access data from a previous checkpoint, a common node relies on permanodes. An alternative is to subscribe to a specific tag. Whenever an incoming transaction features this tag, the node stores it locally. 

Permanodes are computers with large storage and bandwidth capacity that store the entire history of the Tangle. At the time of writing this thesis, the Tangle grows nearly 3GB in size every week with a total size of 300GB since day one. A permanodes also has the ability to make snapshots in order to reduce the size. However, this also results in a loss of the message and tag field for every transaction before the snapshot.
