\section{Economic Clustering}\label{economic-clustering}

Economic Clustering is a theoretical approach for more scalability. It is inspired by global real-world economies. The global economy is divided up into regional economies. These local economies coexist but do not influence each other. 

When this concept of global economies is applied to IOTA, each of these local economies represents a cluster. Clusters run their own tangle. Clusters are not compatible and one can only transact within a cluster. Thus, there is a need for inter-cluster exchanges, which are users or institutions that have funds in multiple clusters.
