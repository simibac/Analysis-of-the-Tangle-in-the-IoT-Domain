\section{Network Partition}

The tangle does not know the discrepancy of validating nodes (miners) and issuing nodes in a sense that Bitcoin does. Every node in the network can issue and validate transactions. A new transaction is  
what motivates nodes to validate and propagate transactions. Each node calculates statistics about the activity of its neighbors. If a neighbor appears to be lazy, it can be dropped. For this reason, a node in the network is incentivized to participate in the network, even at times when it does not issue transactions.
